"For each assignment, you must specifically describe in your README.txt file, 
whatever help (if any) that you received from others. You must list the names 
of any individuals with whom you collaborated. This includes help from internet 
searches, the course discussion boards, textbook, friends, classmates, GAs, 
co-workers, tutors, family members and the instructor" (Gabai).
